# Odinbook Backend, final project for The Odin Project

This is the backend repository (the website has been deployed on [netlify](https://radiant-piroshki-78e42e.netlify.app)).
You can login with a Facebook account (which will be used to create an account for you), or if you want to browse the website, you can use a Guest Account. Contact me and I will provide you a password. 

## Context

This is a very simplified version of Facebook. You can add friends, create posts and write comments on your friends' posts. 

## Backend frameworks

I used Express and MongoDB to develop the backend.

## Frontend 

For the frontend I used React and Tailwind (styled minimaly at the moment). You can find the repository on [github](https://github.com/paposeco/odinbook) too.
